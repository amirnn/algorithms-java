# Java Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of key data structures and algorithms implemented using Modern Java (Java 23) and its best practices. The goal is to build everything from the ground up without relying on advanced libraries or "fancy" structures, ensuring a clear understanding of the underlying principles.

---

## Overview

Leveraging the latest features of Modern Java, this project demonstrates custom implementations of essential data structures and algorithms. Each implementation is crafted with simplicity and clarity in mind, making it a valuable resource for learning and inspiration.

---

## Folder Structure

- **src/main/java**  
  Contains the primary source code for the data structures and algorithms. Each component is organized into its own package to maintain a clean and modular structure.

- **src/test/java**  
  Houses unit tests for verifying the correctness and robustness of the implementations.
